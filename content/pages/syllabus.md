Lectures: 1 session / week, 3 hrs / session

Prerequisites
-------------

All four of the following:

*   [24.951 Introduction to Syntax](/courses/24-951-introduction-to-syntax-fall-2003)
*   [24.952 Advanced Syntax](/courses/24-952-advanced-syntax-spring-2007)
*   24.970 Introduction to Semantics
*   [24.973 Advanced Semantics](/courses/24-973-advanced-semantics-spring-2009)

Course Description
------------------

This course focuses on the process by which native speakers of a language acquire the ability to speak and understand that language. We will cover some of the major results in the study of first-language acquisition, concentrating on morpho-syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. The findings primarily come from English, but cross-linguistic differences in the phenomena of interest and corresponding differences in acquisition patterns are considered where appropriate. Of interest throughout is how these developmental data inform linguistic theory and/or learnability theory.

Requirements
------------

The requirements for participation in this course are that:

*   You show up;
*   You participate in discussion;
*   You send me a response (one page maximum) to readings for the coming class by Sunday evening at 6 pm.

If you are taking the course for credit, you must, in addition, develop an acquisition-related research topic of your own interest. See the {{% resource_link c6952a87-61ce-963f-c294-69f46f9ba911 "Assignments" %}} page for more details.
